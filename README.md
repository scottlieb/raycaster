# raycaster
## A Simple Raycaster Engine Written in Rust

### Motivation
This is a small pet-project for me to learn about Rust and computer graphics :)

### Progress
- Register key input from user and draw pixels to window at a controlled frame-rate ✔️
- Create a 2D world with a moveable character ✔️
- Cast rays from the character to calculate nearest walls ✔️
- Render walls as pseudo-3D ✔️
- Add nice features like textures, collisions, cielings etc... In Progress...
- Create ambient lighting TODO

### Screenshot
At this point it's basically Unreal engine...
